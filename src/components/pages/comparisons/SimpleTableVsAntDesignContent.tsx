      When you choose Ant Design for your React project, you're making a commitment to an entire
      design system—not just individual components. This comprehensive approach brings consistency
      and polished UI elements, but it also means that adding a simple table component requires
      pulling in the{" "}

      . For many teams, this raises a critical question: is the visual consistency worth the massive
      bundle size impact, especially when the table component itself lacks many advanced data grid
      features?{" "}

      , it delivers more data grid functionality than Ant Design Table while being 240x smaller. But
      the choice isn't just about file size—it's about architectural decisions that affect your
      entire application's performance, from initial load times to runtime memory usage. This
      comparison examines whether you can achieve both design consistency AND performance by
      choosing Simple Table, even within Ant Design projects. We'll explore styling strategies,
      bundle optimization techniques, and help you determine whether Ant Design Table's framework
      integration justifies its massive overhead for your specific use case.

        is a lightweight, standalone data grid that provides essential features with minimal
